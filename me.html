<p class="p1">
    Hi:) I'm Astrid!
      I am a Landscape Architecture student who graduated from the University of Melbourne, and studying in major of computing in ANU now.
    AS a self-driven person, I have accumulated various landscape architecture design experience, such as the nature reserve, urban landscaping, residential
    public space and parametric design.At the mean time, I am also fond of doing graphic project like designing typeface/logo/poster etc.
    A-studio was the name of Astrid's social account for sharing graphic and landscape works. Creating an online personal portfolio
    website named A-Studio illustrating Astrid Liu 's projects collections as well as introduction, can bring more visitors who are interested in
    these two specific areas here to communicate with their opinion. With the curriculum vitae and contact information, potential clients can find
    it easy to contact with Astrid and provide with a job or cooperation offer.The A-studio will provide a clear classification of different project
    for visitors to explore with.</p>

<h2> My passion </h2>
<form enctype="text/plain">
<p class="p1"> Landscape architecture is a discipline that focuses on intervention through the activities of planning, design, and management.
    I trust the power of nature and always be passionate about the landscaping projects that not only echoing humanities but also with prospect of
    sustainable development at the same time. Moreover, graphic design make the way of conveying idea become wonderful. </p>

    <h2> Reflection </h2>
    <form enctype="text/plain">
        <p class="p1"> By creating the website myself, I was able to gain a deeper grasp of website design. I learned that creating a website is not
            as same as designing the landscape projects. Rather than having a big picture in your mind, noticing every element's characteristic also would be a necessary process.
            They all must have an exact value for its width, height, margin, and padding when utilising HTML and CSS. Additionally,
            while building a website, I must take into account how it will look on various screen sizes, thus I should always use proportions rather than pixels.
           </p>
        <br>
        <p class="p1"> Moreover, in the future, I will reduce the CSS file size and distinguish various elements with class and id.There are certain things I would have done differently if I had known earlier
            . In terms of CSS, I used to write a separate CSS file for each component of a webpage, such as the navbar, the main body, and the picture portion. However, I discovered that if two CSS files reference the same component,
            there would be conflicts. This caused me a lot of problems in determining which file I should edit. </p>
